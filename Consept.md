the game consept make me decide on some rules.
 All of this rules may review and change by others
 A main concept of the game is to educate for social understanding .
Fact is that a gaming piece viewed green color in one side and red color in the next side.
It's according to the traffic signals rules on a junction.
Another concept is that each player is depanded by the other actions.
That the reason that it may be include odd-count of pieces, it shows than they are not devided equally to the two player, but the the pieces (in the basic form) are all free for use for each side.
Also there is no differance between the two sides who get which color.
Each player view his side of the wall broad the same. In each side , the green is positive and red is negative.
No stress, the presentation of the board may be considered in the end of the moovings, when he board is full of pieces - the players sould count their positive points and by that to decide who secceeded...
