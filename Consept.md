the game consept make me decide on some rules.
 All of this rules may review and change by others
 A main concept of the game is to educate for social understanding .
The gaming pieces viewed yellow and pink color, most of them with both colors in their two sides.
The game made in a two sides board - like a wall 
The uniqe shape of the board gives it's name - heart.
I thought on a simple way to number each of the squers of the wall by the grid of decimal square table.
the left coloumn built by the places of 21, 31 and the right colounm is 29, 39
///...
Another concept is that each player is depanded by the other actions.
