The seccond version may manufacure in local factory and there cost will be at least 55$ for customer cost.   
The basic Idea is to create it with simple number of elements. a two-sided stood wall of 8 rows and 6 coloumns.
As so - there are supposed to be 20 long pieces and 8 cubes.
each of the player will start play with 10 long pieces and 4 cubes
all of the cubes are similar and so are the longs, 
a cube have 6 sides, up down N S W E. if a certain side painted by a green color so the negative side painted in red color(Up-down for example)
the princip is that if a player threw a cube and got the green color so he would place it so the green color viewed his side of the wall
It will presented like that while the seccond player would view the red color of the cube in his side of the wall.
